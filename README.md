#Randomhop

##What?
A simple web app that accesses and displays randomly selected photos from a user's Facebook account.

##Why?
In order to practice using OAuth, and strengthen our skills working with some of the other technologies we've been introduced to during the course (APIs, Hapi, Sass, Agile working process, etc.).

#How?
A user logs into the app through their Facebook account, giving us their name and ID, which then allows us to access their photos through an API call.
